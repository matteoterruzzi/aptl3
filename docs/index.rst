Welcome to the docs of aptl3
============================

aptl3 is a library and a Qt desktop application whose goal is to help you access a private collection of media by
providing a natural interface, with search and exploration functionalities, to a neural embeddings database, built using
pretrained models (already available on the net), joined to perform cross-modal retrieval using different AI techniques.

Text-image search on your laptop, in simple words. Plus some scalability and an easy-to-use app.

**Disclaimer**: the project is in early dev. stage and all the APIs are subject to ongoing changes!
